        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Juan Ventura, and I am currently a junior at 
            SUNY Farmingdale, where I am pursuing my degree in Computer Science. 
            Born and raised on Long Island, New York, I have always been fascinated
            by technology and how it shapes the world around us. This interest led me 
            to choose computer science as my major, and I couldn't be more excited to dive 
            deeper into this ever-evolving field.

            As an intermediate-level programmer, I am continuously learning new skills and honing my craft. 
            I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems and the satisfaction that comes with writing clean, 
            efficient code. Every day is an opportunity to improve, whether it's mastering a new programming language, 
            exploring innovative technologies, or tackling real-world projects. I believe in the power of technology to create meaningful change, and I’m passionate about using my skills to contribute to that change.

            Throughout my academic journey, I've gained hands-on experience in various areas of computer science, and 
            I am always eager to expand my knowledge. Whether it’s working on personal coding projects, collaborating with peers, 
            or diving into coursework, I approach every challenge with determination and curiosity.

Looking ahead, I’m excited about the many opportunities in computer science and am committed to growing as both a programmer and a professional. 
I’m always open to learning new things and exploring different areas within the field, and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me.
